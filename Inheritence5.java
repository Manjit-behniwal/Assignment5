/*
6. Can a top level class be private or protected? 
*/


Sol. 
 No. A top level class can not be private or protected.
It can have either "public" or no modifier.
If it does not have a modifier it is supposed to have a default access.
If a top level class is declared as private the compiler will 
complain that the "modifier private is not allowed here". 
This means that a top level class can not be private. 
Same is the case with protected.
