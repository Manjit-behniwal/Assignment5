/*
3. Are constructors and initializers also inherited to sub classes.?*/

Sol. 
 
A constructor cannot be inherited, since in subclasses it has a different name (the name of the subclass).Constructors are not members of classes,and only members are inherited.

The constructor is not inherited but you are still able to call it.
